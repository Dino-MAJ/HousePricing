In this code, I predicted house prices in California using machine-learning concepts. My highest score was a 81% using the RandomForest, though I also used Linear Regression and Neural Networks.
I parsed a massive CSV, and made numerous visualizations of the data to better understand what I was working with. I used correltation heatmaps and histograms.
I also used feature engineering to obtain new features to train on, and these led me to ultimately have a higher prediction score.
